# PixelTester

This is a testing app for the [Pocuter One](https://pocuter.com/pocuter-one). It allows to change the color of the display in order to diagnose problems with the panel itself (e.g. dead or stuck pixels). It also allows for flashing the screen in order to try to revive/unstuck pixels.
